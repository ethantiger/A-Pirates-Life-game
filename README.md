# Story
The game is fairly straight forward. You are a prisoner on a pirate ship and must escape. There are 2 different endings: one where you take over the ship, and one where you escape the ship (Decide carefully whether you leave the crew or save them). Each level has it's own task / minigame to be played with a total of four stages in the game.

# Game Guide: For the beginning
The game hints at the fact that the guard has left the post at 12:00 PM (since it's sunny outside). So choose to sleep at that time to proceed.
